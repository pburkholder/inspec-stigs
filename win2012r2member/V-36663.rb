  title 'System BIOS or system controllers must have administrator accounts/passwords configured.'
  desc 'A systems BIOS or system controller handles the initial startup of a system, and its configuration must be protected from unauthorized modification.  When the BIOS or system controller supports the creation of user accounts or passwords, such protections must be used and accounts/passwords only assigned to system administrators.  Failure to protect BIOS or system controller settings could result in Denial of Service or compromise of the system resulting from unauthorized configuration changes.'
