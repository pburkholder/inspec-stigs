  desc 'The FTP (File Transfer Protocol) service allows remote users to access shared files and directories.  Allowing anonymous FTP connections makes user auditing difficult.  Using accounts that have administrator privileges to log on to FTP risks that the userid and password will be captured on the network and give administrator access to an unauthorized user.'
