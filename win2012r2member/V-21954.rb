  tag checktext: 'Verify whether the registry key below exists.  If it does not exist or the value is "0", this is not a finding.
If the registry key exists and contains a value other than "0", continue below.

The values are determined by the selection of encryption suites in the policy Computer Configuration >> Windows Settings >> Security Settings >> Local Policies >> Security Options >> "Network Security: Configure encryption types allowed for Kerberos".

Registry Hive:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
Registry Path:  \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Kerberos\Parameters\
Value Name:  SupportedEncryptionTypes
Type:  REG_DWORD

Due to the number of possible combinations that may include the DES encryption types, it is not possible to include all acceptable values as viewed directly in the registry.

If the registry key does exist, the value must be converted to binary to determine configuration of specific bits.  This will determine whether this is a finding.

Note the value for the registry key.
For example, when all suites, including the DES suites are selected, the value will be "0x7fffffff (2147483647)".

Open the Windows calculator (Run/Search for "calc").
Select "View", then "Programmer".
Select "Dword" and either "Hex" or "Dec".
Enter the appropriate form of the value found for the registry key (e.g., Hex - enter 0x7fffffff, Dec - enter 2147483647)
Select "Bin".
The returned value may vary in length, up to 32 characters.
If the either of 2 right most characters are "1", this is a finding.
If the both of 2 right most characters are "0", this is not a finding.'
