  desc 'Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.  The "Deny access to this computer from the network" user right defines the accounts that are prevented from logging on from the network.  In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.  Local accounts on domain-joined systems must also be assigned this right to decrease the risk of lateral movement resulting from credential theft attacks.  The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated access.'
