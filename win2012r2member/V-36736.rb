  desc 'Failure to verify a certificates revocation status can result in the system accepting a revoked, and therefore unauthorized, certificate.  This could result in the installation of unauthorized software or a connection for rogue networks, depending on the use for which the certificate is intended.   Querying for certificate revocation mitigates the risk that the system will accept an unauthorized certificate.'
