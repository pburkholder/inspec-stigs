  desc 'The account lockout feature, when enabled, prevents brute-force password attacks on the system.  This parameter specifies the period of time that must pass after failed logon attempts before the counter is reset to 0.  The smaller this value is, the less effective the account lockout feature will be in protecting the local system.'
