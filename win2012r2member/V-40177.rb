  tag checktext: 'The default permissions are adequate when the Security Option "Network access: Let everyone permissions apply to anonymous users" is set to "Disabled" (V-3377).  If the default ACLs are maintained and the referenced option is set to "Disabled", this is not a finding.

Verify the default permissions for the program file directories (Program Files and Program Files (x86)).  Nonprivileged groups such as Users or Authenticated Users must not have greater than Read & execute permissions except where noted as defaults.  (Individual accounts must not be used to assign permissions.)

Viewing in File Explorer:
For each folder, view the Properties.
Select the "Security" tab, and the "Advanced" button.

Default Permissions:
\Program Files and \Program Files (x86)
Type - "Allow" for all
Inherited from - "None" for all

Alternately, use Icacls:

Open a Command prompt (admin).
Enter icacls followed by the directory:

icacls "c:\program files"
icacls "c:\program files (x86)"

The following results should be displayed as each is entered:

c:\program files
