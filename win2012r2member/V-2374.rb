  desc 'Allowing Autoplay to execute may introduce malicious code to a system.  Autoplay begins reading from a drive as soon media is inserted into the drive.  As a result, the setup file of programs or music on audio media may start.  By default, Autoplay is disabled on removable drives, such as the floppy disk drive (but not the CD-ROM drive) and on network drives.  Enabling this policy disables Autoplay on all drives.'
