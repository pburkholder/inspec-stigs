  desc 'Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.  The "Deny log on locally" user right defines accounts that are prevented from logging on interactively.    In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.  The Guests group must be assigned this right to prevent unauthenticated access.'
