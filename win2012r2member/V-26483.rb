  desc 'Inappropriate granting of user rights can provide system, administrative, and other high-level capabilities.  The "Deny log on as a batch job" user right defines accounts that are prevented from logging on to the system as a batch job such, as Task Scheduler.    In an Active Directory Domain, denying logons to the Enterprise Admins and Domain Admins groups on lower-trust systems helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation from credential theft attacks which could lead to the compromise of an entire domain.  The Guests group must be assigned to prevent unauthenticated access.'
