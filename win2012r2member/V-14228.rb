  desc 'Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises that have occurred, as well as detect attacks.  Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised.  Collecting this data is essential for analyzing the security of information assets and detecting signs of suspicious and unexpected behavior. This setting prevents the system from setting up a default system access control list for certain system objects, which could create a very large number of security events, filling the security log in Windows and making it difficult to identify actual issues.'
