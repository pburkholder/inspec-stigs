  desc 'Configuring the system to ignore name release requests, except from WINS servers, prevents a denial of service (DoS) attack.  The DoS consists of sending a NetBIOS name release request to the server for each entry in the servers cache, causing a response delay in the normal operation of the servers WINS resolution capability.'
