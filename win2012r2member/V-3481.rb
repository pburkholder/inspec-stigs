  desc 'The Windows Media Player uses software components, referred to as Codecs, to play back media files.  By default, when an unknown file type is opened with the Media Player, it will search the Internet for the appropriate Codec and automatically download it.  To ensure platform consistency and to protect against new vulnerabilities associated with media types, all Codecs must be installed by the System Administrator.'
