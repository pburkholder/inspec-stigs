  desc 'Some features may communicate with the vendor, sending system information or downloading data or components for the feature.  Turning off this capability will prevent potentially sensitive information from being sent outside the enterprise and uncontrolled updates to the system.   This setting ensures users cannot provide ratings feedback to Microsoft for Help content.'
