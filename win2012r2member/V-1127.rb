  desc 'An account that does not have Administrator duties must not have Administrator rights.  Such rights would allow the account to bypass or modify required security restrictions on that machine and make it vulnerable to attack.  System administrators must log on to systems only using accounts with the minimum level of authority necessary.  For domain-joined member servers, the Domain Admins group must be replaced by a domain member server administrator group (see V-36433 in the Active Directory Domain STIG).  Restricting highly privileged accounts from the local Administrators group helps mitigate the risk of privilege escalation resulting from credential theft attacks.   Systems dedicated to the management of Active Directory (AD admin platforms, see V-36436 in the Active Directory Domain STIG) are exempt from this.  AD admin platforms may use the Domain Admins group or a domain administrative group created specifically for AD admin platforms (see V-43711 in the Active Directory Domain STIG).  Standard user accounts must not be members of the built-in Administrators group.'
