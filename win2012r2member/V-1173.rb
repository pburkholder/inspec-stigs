  desc 'Windows systems maintain a global list of shared system resources such as DOS device names, mutexes, and semaphores.  Each type of object is created with a default DACL that specifies who can access the objects with what permissions.  If this policy is enabled, the default DACL is stronger, allowing nonadministrative users to read shared objects, but not modify shared objects that they did not create.'
