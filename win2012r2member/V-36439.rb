With User Account Control enabled, filtering the privileged token for local administrator accounts will prevent the elevated privileges of these accounts from being used over the network.'

This setting may cause issues with some network scanning tools if local administrative accounts are used remotely. Scans should use domain accounts where possible. If a local administrative account must be used, temporarily enabling the privileged token by configuring the registry value to 1 may be required.'
